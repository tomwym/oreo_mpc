OREO is a 7-degree-of-freedom robotic head that is modelled on the primate visual system. It performs saccades at realistic human speeds. The eyes have a realistic range of motion, including vergence. It also supports rapid changes in focus distance.

Further documentation is in development. In the mean time please contact Bryan Tripp (bptripp@uwaterloo.ca) for more information.
